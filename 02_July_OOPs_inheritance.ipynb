        "\n",
        "Ans -The most significant components of Object Oriented Programming is inheritance. Inheritance is provides code re-usability. In place of writing the same code, again and again, we can simply inherit the properties of one class into the other. Inheritance is a technique of modelling real-world relationships, and OOP is all about real-world objects.Subclass is a class which inherits the other class. It is also called a derived class or child class. The features of a subclass are inherited from the superclass. It's also known as a parent class or a base class.\n",

        "Inheritance is used in oop's beacause of reusability, is a feature that allows you to reuse the fields and methods of an existing class while creating a new one. The fields and methods defined in the preceding class can be reused. It helps to reduce the duplicate code by sharing common code"

        "\n",
        "Ans- Single Inheritance - When child class is **derived from only one parent class**. This is called single inheritance. Consider we have two classes i.e class A (parent class) and class B (child class). Class B (child class) is derived from class A. Class B holds all the properties of class A. It is the **inheritance type that is most frequently used**. It is **simplier than multiple inheritance**.\n",

In multiple inheritance, we have two parent classes and one child class that inherits both parent classes properties. It has advantage if we have a requirement of **gathering multiple characteristics from different classes**.It is **complex than single inhertance**.\n",
